The videos above are play throughs of my released maps being played by a community member. These two maps are the first two in a five map series I am working on. The theme for the series is for each map to focus on one gameplay mechanic and make it as fun as possible. All of the maps I release will be hosted on the Portal 2 Steam Workshop under the username Patches [here](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198024474916/myworkshopfiles/?appid=620).
